# FreeChannelManagement-Booking-etc.-
An easy and quick way to connect your room avalabilities with your own calendar and share it with your employees.

## Introduction 
We needed a cheap and quick way to synconize all our channels like booking.com, airbnb and our own website automatically.

Since you we couldn't find any appropiate channel manager for free, we now use google calendar. 
+ synchronize automatically
+ shareable to our employees
+ completly free
- updates can be to slow for short note bookings (5 hours before arrival)

## How to use it?

First of all you need a google account. We created a new one for our buissness.
