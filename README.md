# FreeChannelManagement-Booking-etc.-
An easy and quick way to connect your room availabilities with your own calendar and share it with your employees.

## Introduction 
We needed a cheap and quick way to synconize all our channels like booking.com, airbnb and our own website automatically.
There are some good Channel Manager available but we have only 14 rooms and it would cost us 89 € per month, just to sync those.

Since you we couldn't find any appropriate channel manager for free, we now use google calendar. 
+ synchronize automatically
+ shareable to our employees
+ completly free
- updates can be to slow for short note bookings (5 hours before arrival)
