# FreeChannelManagement-Booking-etc.
An easy and quick way to connect your room availabilities with your own calendar and share it with your employees.

## Introduction 
We needed a cheap and quick way to synconize all our channels like booking.com, airbnb and our own website automatically.
There are some good Channel Manager available but we have only 14 rooms and it would cost us 89 € per month by using one of the major channelmanager, just to sync those.

Since we couldn't find any appropriate channel manager for free, we now use google calendar. 
* \+ synchronize automatically
* \+ shareable to our employees
* \+ completly free
* \+ mobile app included
* \- updates can be to slow for short note bookings (5 hours before arrival)
* \- some little details like booking only transfers 'closed' and the room as information

### Sync Booking

#### 1 Export calendar
Net step is to sync this calendar with the calendar of our room 02 on booking.com. Therefore log in to your facility managment: https://admin.booking.com/ and go to your calendar overview.

<img align="center" height="300" src="https://github.com/DanielBuerger/FreeChannelManagement-Booking-etc.-/blob/master/Images/bookingmenu.PNG">

Click on the room that you want to synchronise, use 'sync calendar', 'eport calendar' and choose to just 'sync my bookings'. Now, copy the link.

<img align="center" height="300" src="https://github.com/DanielBuerger/FreeChannelManagement-Booking-etc.-/blob/master/Images/importcalendar.PNG"><img align="center" height="300" src="https://github.com/DanielBuerger/FreeChannelManagement-Booking-etc.-/blob/master/Images/eportcalendar2.PNG">

Go to Google calendar and add another calendar. This time choose calendar by URL, paste the link from booking.com and name it something like 'room 02 booking'.

<img align="center" height="300" src="https://github.com/DanielBuerger/FreeChannelManagement-Booking-etc.-/blob/master/Images/addCalendar.PNG">

#### 2 Import calendar
Now we also want that booking closes our room, as soon as we have a new reservation manually from somewhere else.

Go to your Google calendar room 02 and enter the settings. Scroll down until you see 'Integrate calendar'.
<img align="center" height="500" src="https://github.com/DanielBuerger/FreeChannelManagement-Booking-etc.-/blob/master/Images/calendarlink.PNG">

Copy the 'secret address in ICali format', go to your booking.com calendar, choose import and paste the link.

## Done, you now have your own free channel manager.
